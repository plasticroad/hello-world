# hello-world
Hello Everyone:

Originally from Venezuela, I graduated with a graduate-level geochemistry degree in 2006 and began my career with the Venezuelan geological and mining service. I then worked for a major international mining company both as an employee and later as an independent contractor. After witnessing the devastation of Venezuelaâ€™s natural resources, I founded Goldschmidt Geoconsulting in 2009, an environmental consulting firm that remediated soils and mitigated the damage created by the illegal mining operations in the Amazonian Rainforest. My professional experience includes laboratory and statistical analytics, geological and geochemical field work, quality control and assurance, and management. 

The political situation in Venezuela lead me to terminate my firm and immigrate to the U.S. in 2013. I began learning English at that time and became a teacher in order to stay here legally with an H1B Visa. I was issued a green card in March 2017 and I am now a permanent resident authorized to work in the United States. I am currently expanding my skillset to include advanced-level coding and programing, GIS, and data science.
